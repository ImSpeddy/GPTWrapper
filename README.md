# ChatGPT Wrapper

A simple ChatGPT Wrapper based of the ChatGPT Windows/Mac app designed for Linux users.
The wrapper is built in Electron.

## Features
- **Shortcut Compliant**
  - Uses the same shortcut as the official ChatGPT app (`Alt + Space`).
  
    This shortcut toggles a quick window giving quick access to ChatGPT.
- **System Tray Icon**
  - Includes a system tray icon that lets you open a bigger window and lets you quit the app.

This wrapper is not endorsed by OpenAI and therefore, is not official.
